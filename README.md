# 🤖 Efficient Fine-Tuning of Open-Source LLMS

In this repo, we'll be fine-tuning a GPT-style model using peft, transformers, and bitsandbytes. We'll task fine-tune Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 using QLoRA/LoRA.

# ⚙️The Build Process 🏗️
* Create a Python 3.11 environment
* pip install jupyter
* pip install -r requirements.txt
* Load the model
* Prep the data
* Create the create_prompt function
* Set up PEFT LoRA
* Train the model
* Share the model
